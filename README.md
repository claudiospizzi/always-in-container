# Always In Container 2

This Add-On optimizes the original Always In Container Add-On for Firefox. The original Add-On can be found here: [tiansh/always-in-container](https://github.com/tiansh/always-in-container).

Optimizations:

* Better more consistent layout
* Sorting of containers by icon and then by name (with this, the containers are categorized by icon)
* Highlighting of the typed and matched keys
